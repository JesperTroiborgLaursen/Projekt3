Notes for running BPMeasurer:
The project will most likely open with a folder in visual studio named "Org". 
This folder contains old files due to our (bad) decision to use JRT's GitHub repository for ST3PRJ3 as base for our own implemtation.
"Org" will not load properly and will result in several errors. Therefore it should just be unloaded with all it projects and thereafter hidden.

Furthermore, the project will not build without a RaspberryPi connected. Neither will it run without at RPi with and ADC which returns valid values.
